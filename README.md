## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge taught me a lot! I learned new concepts such as media queries, the CSS overflow property, how to clearly comment my code, semantic HTML elements, the use of variables, and much more.

Although I faced some difficulties‚Äîespecially with media queries‚ÄîI managed to overcome them thanks to solutions shared by other community members, ChatGPT (of course üòÅ ‚Äî but no copy-pasting ‚úä), and Zeal Doc, which helped me get a better overview of HTML and CSS elements.

Huge thanks to everyone!!!
